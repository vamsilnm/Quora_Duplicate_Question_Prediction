# Quora_Duplicate_Question_Prediction
There are many approaches for finding whether a question pair is duplicate or not
I have used wordnet library initially for the task. By using wordnet a similarity matrix of words is built and then I have found similarity between two questions and later I need to fix a threshold for predicting duplicate questions.
